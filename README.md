# FBR PTSD
Code to conduct a series of analyses concerning PTSD within Indigenous Australians.

The data for all these analyses were collected as part of the [Family Business Report](https://www.beyondblue.org.au/docs/default-source/research-project-files/bw0284-the-family-business-final-report.pdf?sfvrsn=6) funded by [Beyond Blue](https://www.beyondblue.org.au/)

Folders include:
- Prevalence
- Identification

None of the raw data are available here (as it is quite sensitive).
